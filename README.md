## Fixed Error: 

Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I gave my 100% effort in this assessment and fixed all the errors that I understood. I am also curious to know my mistakes because I want to improve upon them.

1.The div container element and its contents are placed within the body section, where visible content should be located. The JavaScript code is placed at the end of the body section to ensure that all HTML elements are loaded before the script is executed.

2.I fixed a syntax error where you mistakenly put a semicolon in the image link. Semicolons are not required in URLs.

3.I replaced img_layout from this section because by default, it was showing the layout image, and for the expected input in the first dropdown, it should display the book image.

4.I replaced Math.random() * 4 with (Math.random() * quote.length) to access a random quote dynamically.

5.I removed the unnecessary async keyword that was mistakenly used in window.onload because there is no need to use async-await here.

6.I updated the image URLs for Book and Bird options from 500/250 to 600/400, ensuring correct dimensions for all options in the photo gallery.

7.I understood the errors and fixed them so I removed them and improved the maintainability of the code. I also tried to enhance the code's readability.
